ML models for forecasting sales (time series) by aggregated product groups. Made during my internship in Mars as initiative project for showing possibility to increase accuracy of demand prediction (my diploma project). The main models are: holtwinters ExponentialSmoothing, SARIMA.

### Data
History of sales of 3 product cathegories for 3-4 years


### Libraries
- pandas,
- numpy,
- sklearn,
- scipy,
- matplotlib.pyplot,
